<h1 align="center">8 Queen Problem Solved using Gradient Descent Algorithm</h1>

<p align="justify">This is a Python implementation of the 8 queen problem using the Gradient Descent algorithm. The goal of the 8 queen problem is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be placed on the same row, column, or diagonal. The Gradient Descent algorithm is used to find the optimal solution that minimizes the number of conflicts between the queens.</p>
